        <h4>FEATHERS FROM A THOUSAND LI AWAY</h4>
        <p>
            Now the woman was old. 
            And she had a daughter who grew up speaking only English and swallowing more Coca-Cola than sorrow. 
            For a long time now the woman had wanted to give her daughter the single swan feather and tell her, 
            "This feather may look worthless, but it comes from afar and carries with it all my good intentions." 
            And she waited, year after year, for the day she could tell her daughter this in perfect American English.
