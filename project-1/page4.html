        <h3>FEATHERS FROM A THOUSAND LI AWAY</h3>
        <p>
            The old woman remembered a swan she had bought many years ago in Shanghai for a foolish sum. This bird, boasted the market vendor, was once a duck that stretched its neck in hopes of becoming a goose, and now look!â€”it is too beautiful to eat.
            <br>
            Then the woman and the swan sailed across an ocean many thousands of li wide, stretching their necks toward America. 
            On her journey she cooed to the swan: "In America I will have a daughter just like me. 
            But over there nobody will say her worth is measured by the loudness of her husband's belch. 
            Over there nobody will look down on her, because I will make her speak only perfect American English. 
            nd over there she will always be too full to swallow any sorrow! 
            <a href="page9.html">She will know my meaning</a>, because I will give her this swan-a creature that became more than what was hoped for. "
