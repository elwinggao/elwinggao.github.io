        <h2>QUEEN MOTHER OF THE WESTERN SKIES</h2>
        <p>
            "O! <i>Hwai dungsyi</i>"—You little bad thing—said the woman, teasing her baby granddaughter. 
            "Is Buddha teaching you to laugh for no reason?" 
            As the baby continued to gurgle, the woman felt a deep stirring within her heart.
            <br>
            "Even if I could live forever," she said to the baby, "I still don't know which way I would teach you. 
            I was once so free and innocent. I too laughed for no reason.
            <br>
            "But later I threw away my foolish innocence to protect myself. 
            And then I taught my <a href="page10.html">daughter, your mother,</a> to shed her innocence <a href="page9.html">so she would not be hurt as well</a>."
